# LT2316 H18 Assignment 1

Git project for implementing assignment 1 in [Asad Sayeed's](https://asayeed.github.io) machine learning class in the University of Gothenburg's Masters
of Language Technology programme.

The included dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Balance+Scale).

## Your notes

If you have any notes to include with your submission, put them here.

I find that my metrics come out pretty much perfectly accurate, and that makes me think that something has gone wrong somewhere. It's just too good to be true, right? But yeah, if you get the same results with your testing data I suppose it is time to look at what is going wrong. I have not been able to find it, so perhaps you will have better luck.
